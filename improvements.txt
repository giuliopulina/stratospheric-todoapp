* deploy with kubernetes instead of ecs

* streamline deployment with a different environment / account? (for example, having local, dev, prod)

* make the application more secure by not sharing parameter value but using parameter store
  for example: cognito writes USER_POOL_CLIENT in SSM and the application resolve the value at runtime
  with the proper aws provider

* improve a bit the look and feel of the application that is horrible
