My rewritten version of the app described in the book [Stratospheric - From Zero to Production with Spring Boot and AWS](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric)

Main differences with the original app:

- using Maven instead of Gradle for the Spring Boot application
- a different approach to CDK development: a single stack for the whole infrastructure, using high-level constructs wherever possible
